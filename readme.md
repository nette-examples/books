Nette DI Container Example
==========================

This repository demonstrates the use of Nette's Dependency Injection (DI) Container.


What is Dependency Injection (DI)?
----------------------------------

Dependency Injection (DI) aims to decouple classes from the responsibility of obtaining the objects they require for their operation. Such required objects are referred to as **services**. For an in-depth understanding, refer to the official [Nette DI documentation](https://doc.nette.org/en/dependency-injection).
